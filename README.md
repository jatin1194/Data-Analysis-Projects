## 🔍 Project Overview  
This project explores the **impact of social media usage on students**, analyzing patterns of addiction, screen time, and their potential effects on academic performance and lifestyle. The dataset (from Kaggle) contains survey-based responses that provide insights into how social media habits shape student behavior.  

The analysis includes **data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and insights extraction** to better understand the problem of digital addiction.

## 📂 Methodology  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
   - Handled missing values and duplicates  
   - Encoded categorical data for analysis  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Distribution of daily social media usage  
   - Comparison across demographics (age, gender, etc.)  
   - Correlation analysis of addiction indicators  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar plots, pie charts, and heatmaps  
   - Trend analysis of screen time vs. academic focus  

4. **Insights**  
   - Extracted meaningful patterns connecting behavior with academic impact  

---

## 📊 Key Findings  
- Students with **4+ hours of daily usage** showed higher signs of addiction.  
- Increased social media time was associated with **lower academic focus**.  
- Prolonged usage negatively influenced **sleep cycles and productivity**.  
- Excessive screen time emerged as the strongest predictor of addiction.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack  
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Kaggle  

---

## 🎯 Objective  
To analyze students’ social media usage, detect addictive patterns, and raise awareness of its potential impact on academics and lifestyle.  

---

## 📌 Future Scope  
- Extend analysis with larger and more diverse datasets  
- Apply **machine learning** to predict addiction levels  
- Build **interactive dashboards** (Tableau/Power BI) for real-time insights
